		<h1><center>The website that I have chosen was
			<br> American Folk Art Museum</center></h>

		<h2><a href="http://folkartmuseum.org/">Website</a></h>
		<p>This website interested me because it is a Responsive website. Another reason I was interested in this webiste was because the header moves down the page was you scroll down the page (image one). The last reason this website interested me was something like a text slideshow which I learned to be a 'random background picture css rails' program. The program changes between four different sentences (see images two through five).</p>
