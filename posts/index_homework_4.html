		<h1><center>The website that I have chosen was
			<br> Stanford</center></h>

		<h2><a href="http://arts.stanford.edu/">Website</a></h>
		<p>This website interested me because it is a Responsive website. Another reason I was interested in this website was because of the rollover effects that take place on the home page and the one for students. The last reason this website interested me was the slideshow.</p>
