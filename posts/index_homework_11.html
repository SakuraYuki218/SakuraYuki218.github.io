		<h1><center>The website that I have chosen was
			<br>Just Delete</center></h>

		<h2><a href="http://justdelete.me/#">Website</a></h>
		<p>This website interested me because it is a Responsive website. It features cancellation information for oodles of popular sites and services, letting you know which sites are easy, medium, hard or impossible to quit. Plus it tells you how to go about removing yourself from each one. And it helps you generator a fake identity.
