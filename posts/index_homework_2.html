		<h1><center>The website that I have chosen was
			<br>SpoonGraphics Blog</center></h>

		<h2><a href="http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/">Blog</a></h>
		<p>This website interested me because of all things that can help a graphic designer learn new things. There are tutorials, freebies, articles, videos and news. Another things is that on the bottom of every page there is a short bio on the creator of the page. This website has a cool rollover effect with the image of the creator, which puts a drawing of glasses, a mustache and a beard  on the creators face.</p>
